# üè¶ End-to-End Credit Risk Scoring System Using Machine Learning and GCP

## üìå Overview

This project develops a production-grade **Credit Risk Scoring System** that predicts the likelihood of loan default using financial data. It showcases the full lifecycle of an ML system: from data ingestion and feature engineering to model training, deployment, and monitoring ‚Äî all integrated with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

The solution uses classical ML models (LightGBM, XGBoost) as well as deep learning (PyTorch) to build interpretable and scalable risk models suitable for modern financial institutions.

---

## üéØ Project Goals

- Predict credit default risk using ML algorithms
- Build scalable feature pipelines with **BigQuery**
- Develop automated training pipelines with **Airflow**
- Deploy the model using **Docker** + **GCP Cloud Run / Vertex AI**
- Enable retraining, monitoring, and explainability
- Visualize risk segments with **Tableau / Power BI**

---

## üß† Use Case

Financial institutions need a reliable and automated way to assess the **creditworthiness** of loan applicants. This system uses historical data to create a **credit risk score**, which can be used for:

- Loan approval decisions
- Interest rate setting
- Credit card limit adjustments
- Early risk detection

---

## üìö Dataset

We use the **LendingClub Loan Dataset** (publicly available) which contains anonymized historical data about loan applications including:

- Loan amount, term, interest rate
- Employment length, annual income
- Credit history, payment status
- Target variable: `loan_status` (default / paid)
